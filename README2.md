# Synthetic Covid Curve Generation

Synth_covid is a series of functions that are assocaited with the following preprint article (). This code models and generates sequences of periodic noise similar those observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with this is a sample SIR model that can be combined to create realisitic looking covid outbreaks for use in downstream tasks such as modelling.
